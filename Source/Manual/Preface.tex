\label{Preface} 

The mpFormula CPython library provides a comprehensive set of real and complex functions in multiprecision arithmetic. For a subset of functions there is also support for decimal and interval arithmetic. 

\vpara
It is intended as a companion to the mpFormulaPy library, with a focus on speed and ease of development of additional numerical multiprecision Python code .

 

\vpara
The current version is 0.1, alpha1 (pre-release), and much of the planned functionality is still missing.


\vpara
The mpFormulaPy Library and Toolbox would not exist without the many authors and contributors of the underlying libraries. They are acknowledged in appendix C.
